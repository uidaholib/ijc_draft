# Biography


Leonard Geoffrey Feather (1914- 1994) was raised as part of an upper middle class Jewish family in Hampstead, England. His father ran a chain of clothing stores and later in life became involved in real estate. However, Leonard had no interest in the family businesses, and instead developed an early appreciation for music. He did not attend college, principally because of the economic climate following the Depression. Instead his parents arranged for him to take an extended trip to France and Germany. There he learned everything he could about jazz and began his long career as a journalist.

Feather soon realized that the jazz community in Europe was minuscule compared to what the United States had to offer. Yearning to be at the creative heart of jazz, he made his first trip to the U.S. in 1935, followed by several additional visits during which he immersed himself in the musical scene. He decided to move to America shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, and thus began a long and distinguished career, profoundly impacting the world of jazz.

Leonard made his new home in New York City. While visiting a friend in California in 1945, he was introduced to Jane Leslie Larrabee. Instantly taken by her he proposed the next day. They were married a few weeks later, remaining together for life. Leonard and Jane had one child, Billie Jane Lee Lorraine Feather, named in part after her godmother, Billie Holiday. The Feathers moved to Los Angeles in 1960, and Lorraine Feather went on to become a respected singer, composer, and lyrist.

## Career 

Leonard Feather is regarded as a legend in the realm of jazz. His love affair with this music spanned six decades and his list of accomplishments is impressive. He was involved in almost every aspect of the music industry.

First, Feather was not, by his own admission, much of a business man. This is not to say that he was prone to making questionable choices, only that his motivations were not monetary. He did not exploit artists or their music in order to make a profit. Indeed he had a hard time understanding the nuances of the music business in the beginning and the extent of the abuse of musicians. Leonard Feather was more interested in jazz as an art and a creative process, with little regard for potential profit or the reservations of businessmen and potential critics. He lamented the times when recordings were locked away in a vault or the masters were destroyed, not so much because of the lost money or recognition, but because the music would never be heard by the public.

## Journalist and Critic 

Feather is best known as a jazz journalist and critic. He wrote throughout his life for a wide variety of publications, including Downbeat and Esquire, before moving to California and becoming a regular jazz columnist for The Los Angeles Times. His column for The Times was syndicated to over 500 newspapers. His reports of blindfold tests, in which participants gave their opinions of music after listening blindfolded to a performance, helped to dispel many misconceptions related to race and gender, or even the notion that studio men were not capable of improvising.

## Broadcaster/ Producer

Leonard Feather actively produced movies and radio and television shows.  For most of his career he was almost continually on the air in one form or another. He was featured as a jazz expert on radio shows such as ‘RCA Victor Show’ and the ‘Lower Basin Street Chamber Music and Jazz Society’ program.

In 1940 Feather and Bob Bach created the show ‘Platterbrains’ that aired on WNEW and WMCA in New York. ‘Platterbrains’was a variation on the program he had initiated earlier on Radio Normandy: listeners would send jazz music and recording questions and a panel of experts would try to answer them; segments of the records were played until they attempted a response. It was an excellent way to expose the public not only to recorded jazz music but also to the experts and artists on the panels. In the series' second year, Count Basie recorded the song ‘Platterbrains’ to be used as its theme, based on a Tab Smith original. The show ran for several years and was later revived in 1953. This time ‘Platterbrains’ was broadcast to a much wider audience on the ABC radio network and ran every week until 1958.

Another of Leonard Feather’s early radio projects was ‘Jazz Club USA’ on the U.S. State Department's ‘Voice of America,‘ which broadcast Jazz music and events around the world. Jazz music and news of events were being broadcast around the world. It exposed many people to jazz for the first time and established a large base of listeners, particularly in Eastern Europe and the USSR. Feather continued to work on the air as host, guest, and producer for the rest of his career. He was presented with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting award for excellence in local programming in 1978 for ‘The Leonard Feather Show’ broadcast on KUSC in Los Angeles.

In 1961 Leonard Feather was commissioned by executives at MCA to create 23 short films about jazz to be aired on German television. Since MCA was associated with Universal Pictures, the resulting series Feather on Jazz was built from a vast collection of  footage, some of which had never been seen by the public. The English versions of the narration, however, were never sold and were never seen in the U.S except for the few viewings arranged by Feather himself.

Leonard had many other experiences with television. He served as a consultant for the NBC educational series ‘The Subject is Jazz’ in 1958 and was nominated for an Emmy in 1971 for the production of the KNBC series ‘The Jazz Show’. Leonard Feather also was seen in or contributed to many television programs and acted as a movie consultant. His musical creations have also been used in films, a legacy that continued after his death.

## Musician/ Composer 

Leonard Feather was a talented musician himself though rarely recorded, in part because of the Musician's Union regulations prohibiting the recording of non-members. Feather was a prolific composer and lyrist; he recorded over 100 songs and wrote the album notes for thousands of LPs. In addition he was an active arranger and producer. By his own estimation, his first quality composition was 'Mighty Like the Blues' performed by Benny Carter, Coleman Hawkins, and George Chisholm in 1937.

The list of names associated with Leonard Feather’s work is both long and distinguished: Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Fats Waller, Count Basie, Charlie Barnet, Charlie Parker, Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday, George Shearing, and many others. Some of Feather’s most well-known songs include ‘Evil Gal Blues’, ‘Blow Top Blues’, ‘Dinah’s Blues’, ‘I Remember Bird’, and ‘Twelve Tone Blues’. Possibly his greatest hit was ‘How Blue Can You Get’ first performed by Lois Jordan and B.B. King. Leonard Feather also penned a great many more, lesser-known songs such as 'Get Rich Quick' and 'Taxi Blues'. On October 16, 1951, these songs were the first ever recorded by a teenager named Richard Penniman, later known as Little Richard.

## Author/ Historian 

Leonard Feather was an influential author, historian, and teacher. In his controversial 1949 book Inside Bebop (later retitled Inside Jazz) Feather promoted the new form of jazz characterized by fast tempos and based on a harmonic structure. The music was seen as something of an underground movement at the time, and the book told the story of the evolution of the movement. It contained numerous biographies of relevant musicians and provided a technical analysis of the music. Eventually accepted by traditionalist critics, Inside Bebop helped to establish the new form of jazz as well as the careers of Sarah Vaughan, Charlie Parker, and Dizzy Gillespie. He is perhaps best known as the author of the 1956 book, The Encyclopedia of Jazz. It has been called a cornerstone of jazz historiography. The book not only was a who's who of jazz music, containing information collected via questionnaires from musicians all over the world, but also presented readers a thorough, multidimensional analysis of the genre. Updates and reprints of the work would be published for the next four decades. The last, The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz, was co-authored with Ira Gitler and released posthumously.

Leonard Feather also organized classes and lectured extensively about jazz and jazz history in a higher education setting. In collaboration with Robert Goffin, he organized the first classes devoted to the history and analysis of jazz. The classes were offered at The New School for Social Research in New York beginning February 4, 1942. In later decades he had scheduled visits to lecture at schools including North Texas State University, Berklee College in Boston, and many others. After his relocation to California, Feather spent time lecturing at many of the University of California campuses. 

## Human Rights Advocate 

Above all Leonard Feather was a jazz lover, and he worked his entire life to offset anything that acted to impede originality and inspiration of the art. To this end he was a champion of equal rights. He knew that talent was not confined to any race or gender. He  battled others when they refused to accept new revelations in jazz and continually chafed against limits imposed by the music business. Not believing that jazz was only a western phenomenon, he traveled extensively and helped organize concerts around the world. Everywhere he went he would listen to local groups with a knowing ear and an open mind. He worked for many years on many fronts in order to add to the splendor of the music he loved.

There were some that did not have the same attitude. Music, like all things, has conservatives that are rigid about their preferences and beliefs and do not want it to change. Leonard Feather was innovative, very accepting of new sounds, and pushed the envelope in the evolution of jazz. In 1933 he sent a letter to the editor of Melody Maker asking why no jazz had been recorded in waltz or ¾ time. The editor responded by saying “Asking for jazz in ¾ time is like asking for a red piece of green chalk”<sup>1</sup>. Unperturbed, he continued thinking about the waltz time jazz. Suggesting the idea to Benny Carter they promptly recorded ‘Waltzing the Blues’. The release caused quite a stir and much controversy. Eventually Feather was proven right and the new jazz variation was accepted, although it was almost two decades before waltz time jazz would not be seen as peculiar. Another evolution of jazz embraced and promoted by Leonard Feather was bebop. There had been a war of words going on for years about what was and what was not considered to be jazz. The Esquire jazz polls heightened this debate and raised the ire of the jazz traditionalists, also known as the Moldy Figs. When some musicians began playing a different form of jazz characterized by fast tempos and based on a harmonic structure (bebop), it was summarily denounced by many as not being jazz at all. Leonard’s book entitled Inside Bebop helped put the movement in perspective and helped its eventual acceptance. Still the change came about slowly. After convincing RCA to record some bebop, Feather suggested that the name of the album should be Bebop. Even after they had already agreed to distribute the music they refused to use the name and went with New 52nd Street Jazz instead. The new style was eventually accepted and Leonard made some enemies in the process. To make sure his work would get a fair review he had to resort to using pseudonyms, including using his friend Billy Moore’s name in place of his own.

Gender inequality as a  detriment to jazz creativity was challenged by Leonard Feather. Female singers had been more or less accepted from the beginning, as is shown by the success of Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, and Dinah Washington. However, attitudes held by producers and often the male musicians prevented them from participating in any other way. Feather first met Una Mae Carlisle in 1937 and was instantly impressed by her piano skills as well as her voice. She was a devoted fan of Fats Waller and played in his tradition. It was Una Mae who inspired Leonard to conceive of the blindfold test. In his first article about her in Melody Maker he wrote, “How would you like to submit to a blindfold test, listen to a typical Fats Waller song, then when the bandage was removed find that seated at the keyboard, instead of the 200 pounds of brown skinned masculinity you expected, was a light, slim, smiling girl?”<sup>2</sup>. Feather was determined to dispel the notion that women lacked the physical equipment and poise to play the instruments. His first attempt in recording an all female band called The Hip Chicks met limited success. The later album Girls in Jazz went much more smoothly.  It was an all female recording featuring the Beryl Booker Trio, the Vivian Garry Quintet, the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, and a band put together special for the recording consisting of Mary Lou Williams, Mary Osborne, June Rotenberg, L’Ana Hyams, and Rose Gottesman.  In 1954 he brought many of them back to play on Cats vs. Chicks. Although none of the experiments did well commercially, they were musically sound, quality recordings that proved talent was not restricted to a single gender.

The gravest threat to the creativity and vitality of jazz and the one Leonard Feather worked most intensely to undo was racism. He  worked his entire adult life for equal rights and racial equality. This feeling began during his first trip to the U.S.  Having grown up in London he was completely unprepared for the degree of racism and segregation he witnessed. Even as Feather and others worked to get jazz out more into the main stream, it was a slow process to show that blacks were a major source of talent in jazz music. With that in mind he worked tirelessly to educate and promote jazz talent, regardless of what the artist happened to look like. He also participated in community programs and eventually joined the NAACP, becoming vice president of the Hollywood-Beverly Hills chapter in 1963.
