## Biography


Leonard Geoffrey Feather (1914- 1994) was raised as part of an upper middle class Jewish family in Hampstead, England. His father ran a chain of clothing stores and later in life became involved in real estate. However, Leonard had no interest in the family businesses, and instead developed an early appreciation for music. He did not attend college, principally because of the economic climate following the Depression. Instead his parents arranged for him to take an extended trip to France and Germany. There he learned everything he could about jazz and began his long career as a journalist.

Feather soon realized that the jazz community in Europe was minuscule compared to what the United States had to offer. Yearning to be at the creative heart of jazz, he made his first trip to the U.S. in 1935, followed by several additional visits during which he immersed himself in the musical scene. He decided to move to America shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, and thus began a long and distinguished career, profoundly impacting the world of jazz.

Leonard made his new home in New York City. While visiting a friend in California in 1945, he was introduced to Jane Leslie Larrabee. Instantly taken by her he proposed the next day. They were married a few weeks later, remaining together for life. Leonard and Jane had one child, Billie Jane Lee Lorraine Feather, named in part after her godmother, Billie Holiday. The Feathers moved to Los Angeles in 1960, and Lorraine Feather went on to become a respected singer, composer, and lyrist.

## Career 

Leonard Feather is regarded as a legend in the realm of jazz. His love affair with this music spanned six decades and his list of accomplishments is impressive. He was involved in almost every aspect of the music industry.

First, Feather was not, by his own admission, much of a business man. This is not to say that he was prone to making questionable choices, only that his motivations were not monetary. He did not exploit artists or their music in order to make a profit. Indeed he had a hard time understanding the nuances of the music business in the beginning and the extent of the abuse of musicians. Leonard Feather was more interested in jazz as an art and a creative process, with little regard for potential profit or the reservations of businessmen and potential critics. He lamented the times when recordings were locked away in a vault or the masters were destroyed, not so much because of the lost money or recognition, but because the music would never be heard by the public.
