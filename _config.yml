description: "Lena Corinne Taylor was born on November 30, 1897 to Pleasant John and Olive Taylor. In 1908 her family moved to Kooskia, Idaho. She gained fame as a vaudeville performer, and critics were impressed by Leeâ€™s vocal range. Lee was one of the most recorded female vocalists of the 1920s.

In the mid-1930s, Lee opened a small club in Texas, which a fire destroyed in 1939. She resettled in Rochester, NY. She revitalized her career in a limited way there. She died suddenly in 1954 at the age of 57."
